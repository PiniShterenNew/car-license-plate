Frontend rules:

- UI components are presentational only
- No data fetching logic inside UI components
- No business rules inside JSX

State:
- Use local state only when unavoidable
- Prefer server data and props

Accessibility:
- Semantic HTML
- Keyboard accessible
- Proper labels
- RTL support is mandatory

Performance:
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy-load non-critical components (ads, charts)
