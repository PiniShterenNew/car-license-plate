Backend rules:

- All external API calls must be done server-side only
- All external responses must be validated
- No blind trust in external data

API routes:
- Must be thin controllers
- No heavy logic inside route handlers
- Delegate logic to lib/

Error handling:
- No silent failures
- Always return structured JSON errors
- Never expose raw external API errors to the client

Security:
- Secrets only via environment variables
- Admin access must be protected explicitly
